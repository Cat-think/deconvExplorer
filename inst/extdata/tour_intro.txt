.main-header;Welcome to DeconvExplorer, an interactive framework to perform, evaluate and enhance cell type deconvolution from transcriptome data. <br/>In this tour we will give an overview over DeconvExplorers functionality. DeconvExplorer performs deconvolution with the omnideconv toolset. 
.sidebar;DeconvExplorer is devided into six modules. You can always switch between modules but keep in mind that, while a deconvolution is running, plots are not updating.
#uploadDeconvolutionQ;Upload your data here as a csv, tsv, txt or rds file. Further data requirements are listed below.
#tour_sample;To explore deconvExplorers functionality you can load a sample dataset here. 
#tour_signatureUpload;If required you can upload a custom signature.
[data-value="deconv"];Perform deconvolution analysis and visualize the results. Multiple algorithms can be applied. You can further observe the computed cell fractions and signature. 
[data-value="signatureExploration"];Analyze gene expression signatures. Many visualizations are applicable to compare and understand a signatures composition.
[data-value="signatureRefinement"];Fine-tune your gene expression signature.
[data-value="benchmark"];Compare and benchmark deconvolution results. You can upload a ground truth in the data upload tab. 
[data-value="fInfo"];Find additional information, tutorials and contact details.
