#logo;Welcome to DeconvExplorer, an interactive framework to perform, evaluate and enhance cell type deconvolution from transcriptome data. <br/>In this tour we will give an overview over DeconvExplorers functionality. DeconvExplorer performs deconvolution with the omnideconv toolset. 
.sidebar;DeconvExplorer is devided into six modules. You can always switch between modules but keep in mind that, while a deconvolution is running, plots are not updating.
#tour_upload;Upload your data here as a csv, tsv, txt or rds file. Further data requirements are listed below.
#tour_sample;To test the interface you can load three different sample datasets.
#tour_signatureUpload;If required you can upload a custom signature.
#tour_deconvSettings;To perform a deconvolution, select a deconvolution method. If applicable you can choose a custom signature as well.
#tour_deconvPlotSettings;All deconvolution results are collected here and can be selected for plotting below.
#tour_deconvPlot;All chosen deconvolution results are visualized here. Feel free to explore the different available plotting options!
#tour_genesPlot;The Signature Exploration module plots multiple metrics to analyse and compare expression signatures.
#tour_refinementHeatmap;In the Signature Refinement module you can further subset the genes of a signature to analyse the impact on deconvolution performance.
#tour_infoOverview;More information about each module can be found here.
